> **Note:** Puppeteer uses its own bundled Chromium on Railway. You do not need to set `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` or `PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD`.

## After Deployment

1. **Visit your Railway URL**
2. **Scan WhatsApp QR code**
3. **Test the bot**: Click "Auto Fetch & Send"
4. **Monitor logs**: `railway logs`

## Commands

```bash
# View logs
railway logs

# Check status
railway status

# Update variables
railway variables set VARIABLE_NAME=value

# Redeploy
railway up
```

## Troubleshooting

- **WhatsApp QR Code**: Scan the QR code on your Railway URL
- **Email Issues**: Check your Gmail app password
- **Puppeteer Issues**: No extra config needed on Railway
- **Auto-Scheduler**: Enable with `AUTO_SCHEDULER_ENABLED=true`

Happy deploying! ðŸŽ‰
